The `sms` integration allows having a local execution SMS notification via [Gammu](https://wammu.eu/gammu/). This is ideal when the internet is offline or when the power goes out.

This integration provides the following platforms:
- Notify

## Configuration

To enable those notifications in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sms:
  device: /dev/ttyUSB2

notify:
  - platform: sms
    name: sms_person1
    recipient: PHONE_NUMBER
  - platform: sms
    name: sms_person2
    recipient: PHONE_NUMBER
```
{% configuration %}
device:
  description: The gsm modem device.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

To use notifications, please see the [getting started with automation page](/getting-started/automation/).

If the ingegration is used in HassOS then version [3.6](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassos/releases/tag/3.6) or higher is required.

For installations not running on Hass.io or Docker, you must install `gammu-dev` package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgammu-dev
```

Before running for the first time, check that the modem is recognized by the system by running:

```bash
ls -l /dev/*USB*
```

Note: In Hass.io you need to install the SSH add-on.

## Required Hardware

You will need a USB GSM stick or a mPCIe LTE/GSM/UMTS modem card.

### Note about Raspberry PI 4

On Raspberry PI 4, you need a udev rule in the config USB stick, for the [Huawei E3372-510 stick](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N6P3HI2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for it to be recognized.
